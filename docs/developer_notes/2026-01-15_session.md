# Developer Notes - January 15, 2026

## Session Summary

This session focused on conversion optimization and integrity fixes for the Veruthia Consulting website.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Tally Integration Fix
**Intent:** Update form ID and ensure popup loads correctly.
**Logic:** Tally script was in `<head>`, moved to `<body>` after LenisProvider for proper loading sequence.
**Change:** 
- `src/lib/tally.ts`: Form ID → `rjBLb5`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Script moved to body
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Uses imported TALLY_FORM_ID constant

### 2. Integrity Patch
**Intent:** Remove false claims, ensure honesty.
**Logic:** "Zero No-Shows" is unverifiable. Changed to descriptive "Automated Booking Logic".
**Change:**
- `src/lib/constants.ts`: Metro-Barber stats updated

### 3. Conversion Flow Reorder
**Intent:** Show proof (portfolio) before making promises (services).
**Logic:** Social proof builds trust before asking for investment consideration.
**Change:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Portfolio moved above Services

### 4. Section 179 Hero Badge
**Intent:** Immediately signal tax benefit to business owners.
**Logic:** Gold badge creates urgency and qualifies the investment.
**Change:**
- `src/components/sections/hero.tsx`: Added gold badge below headline

### 5. Pricing Psychology Rewrite
**Intent:** Speak to owner identity, not technical features.
**Logic:** Business owners buy outcomes, not technology.
**Change:**
- Digital Storefront: "You own the keys..."
- AI Receptionist: "Scales infinitely..."
- Business Engine: "Modular Architecture..."

### 6. CMS → Client Control Panel
**Intent:** Remove developer jargon.
**Logic:** "CMS" means nothing to a business owner. "Control Panel" implies ownership and power.
**Change:**
- Global find/replace in `src/lib/constants.ts`

### 7. Unified Infrastructure Banner
**Intent:** Communicate the ecosystem upgrade path.
**Logic:** Reduces friction for future upsells by establishing single-dashboard narrative.
**Change:**
- `src/components/sections/pricing.tsx`: Updated banner text

## Reasoning Audit (Draft → Critique → Refine)

### Example: Pricing Description Rewrite

**Draft:** "Premium Web Build with Client CMS Access. Includes secure Admin Portal."

**Critique:** 
- "CMS" is jargon
- "Premium Web Build" is what we do, not what they get
- Missing emotional hook

**Refine:** "You own the keys. Edit text, images, and offers instantly via your secure Control Panel. No coding required."

Result: Owner-centric, benefit-focused, addresses fear (coding).

---

## Technical Friction

1. **Tally Script Loading:** Initially placed in `<head>` which caused timing issues. Solution: Move to end of `<body>` with `lazyOnload` strategy.

2. **Hash Navigation:** Screenshot tool interprets `/#pricing` as a route, not an anchor. Solution: Just capture `/` and scroll manually if needed.
