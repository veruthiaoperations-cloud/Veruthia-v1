# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## PROJECT: VERUTHIA CONSULTING (v2.0)
## VISION: EXCLUSIVE WHITE-GLOVE DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE

---

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Veruthia Consulting is not a "web design agency." We are a high-end software architecture firm. We build "Assets," not "Websites."

The platform is a portfolio and lead-capture vehicle designed to convert high-net-worth business owners (HVAC, Construction, Service) into consulting clients.

**Key Value Prop:** We turn their manual operations into digital assets that qualify for Section 179 tax benefits.

### 2. THE COMMANDERS

#### ETHAN JOHNSON
**Managing Partner | Operations**

"My 'Red Pill' moment happened at 19, scraping foundations and hauling demolition debris for $12/hour. I watched contractors leave massive profits on the table because they lacked systems. I realized that selling 'hard labor' is a trap; owning Assets is the only way out. I don't sleep until the system works. My reputation is the only asset I refuse to risk."

#### BRODY BAILEY
**Lead Architect | Engineering**

"Code without structure is flying blind. While others build templates, I architect Enterprise-Grade SaaS infrastructure. My rule is absolute: 'If it's not in the PRD, it doesn't exist.' I don't just write code; I build systems that scale the P&L."

### 3. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (THE "WHITE GLOVE" STANDARD)

* **Aesthetic:** "Digital Noir." Rich Black (#050505), premium typography, subtle physics-based animations.
* **Tone:** Authoritative, minimal, expensive. No "marketing fluff."
* **Interaction:** Every click, scroll, and hover must feel "heavy" and intentional (using spring physics).
* **Ownership:** All copy emphasizes "Ownership" and "Assets" over "services."
