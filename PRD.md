# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## PROJECT: VERUTHIA CONSULTING (v1)
## VISION: EXCLUSIVE WHITE-GLOVE DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Veruthia Consulting is not a "web design agency." We are a high-end software architecture firm. We build "Assets," not "Websites."
The v1 platform is a portfolio and lead-capture vehicle designed to convert high-net-worth business owners (HVAC, Construction, Service) into consulting clients.
**Key Value Prop:** We turn their manual operations into digital assets that qualify for Section 179 tax benefits.

### 2. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (THE "WHITE GLOVE" STANDARD)
* **Aesthetic:** "Digital Noir." Dark mode, premium typography, subtle physics-based animations.
* **Tone:** Authoritative, minimal, expensive. No "marketing fluff."
* **Interaction:** Every click, scroll, and hover must feel "heavy" and intentional (using spring physics).

### 3. USER JOURNEY
1.  **The Hook:** User lands on a clean, dark hero section. Headline focuses on "Systems" and "ROI," not "Design."
2.  **The Proof:** User sees the "Portfolio Array" (SmartHVAC, Metro-Barber, etc.). These look like software products, not static sites.
3.  **The Offer:** "The Asset Audit." A call-to-action to see if their business qualifies for a digital overhaul.
4.  **The Conversion:** A multi-step modal (intake form) that feels like a legal document, not a contact form.

### 4. CORE FEATURES
* **Hero Section:** High-impact typography, minimal text.
* **Portfolio Grid:** Interactive cards showcasing our 4 core projects with specific color identities.
* **Services Breakdown:** Clear distinction between "Web Architecture," "Automation," and "Consulting."
* **Pricing/Investment:** High-ticket positioning.
* **Legal Compliance:** Strict adherence to liability disclaimers regarding tax advice.

### 5. SUCCESS METRICS
* **Speed:** 100/100 Lighthouse Score.
* **Clarity:** User understands we build *software* within 5 seconds.
* **Capture:** Intake form successfully saves leads to the Database.
