Instruct the agent to perform a targeted replacement of the `PORTFOLIO_ITEMS` constant within `src/lib/constants.ts`. It must use the following array, which restores the "Metro-Barber-OS" entry and ensures all six portfolio items are present with the correct data structure discovered by the agent in the previous step.

```typescript
I need to perform a targeted update on the file src/lib/constants.ts.

Locate the constant declaration `export const PORTFOLIO_ITEMS = [...]`.

Replace the entire array associated with that constant with the following new array. Do NOT modify any other constants in the file (like DISCLAIMER_TEXT, COMMANDERS, etc.).

This new array restores the "Metro-Barber-OS" project, bringing the total count to six, and uses the exact data structure required by the component.

Here is the new array to use for the replacement:

**Expected outcome:**
The website's portfolio section should now display a full grid of six project cards. The "Metro-Barber-OS" card will be restored, and all other projects will retain their updated information. The agent may also report that it updated the `gradientMap` again to accommodate the restored project.
