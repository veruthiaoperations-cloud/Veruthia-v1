1. The Commanders (Bios - Verbatim):

ETHAN JOHNSON (Managing Partner | Operations):

"My 'Red Pill' moment happened at 19, scraping foundations and hauling demolition debris for $12/hour. I watched contractors leave massive profits on the table because they lacked systems. I realized that selling 'hard labor' is a trap; owning Assets is the only way out. I don't sleep until the system works. My reputation is the only asset I refuse to risk."

BRODY BAILEY (Lead Architect | Engineering):

"Code without structure is flying blind. While others build templates, I architect Enterprise-Grade SaaS infrastructure. My rule is absolute: 'If it's not in the PRD, it doesn't exist.' I don't just write code; I build systems that scale the P&L."

2. The Asset Vault (Portfolio Descriptions):

SmartHVAC Analytics: "92,000 Lines of Code. ServiceTitan Auto-Import. 10 Analysis Playbooks. Multi-Tenant Auth."

Metro-Barber-OS: "Custom CMS & ERP. Native Voice Receptionist Integration. Unified Dashboard. Infinite Scalability."
