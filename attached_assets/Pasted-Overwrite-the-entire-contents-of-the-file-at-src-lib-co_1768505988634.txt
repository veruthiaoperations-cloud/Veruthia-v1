Overwrite the entire contents of the file at `src/lib/constants.ts` with the following TypeScript code. This directly updates the correct data source with the required portfolio information.

```bash
cat > src/lib/constants.ts << EOL
export const PORTFOLIO_ITEMS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "All Care Drain and Leak Detection",
    description: "Full-stack development and digital asset architecture. Achieved a 4-day completion for the initial build, with subsequent CMS updates taking only 3-4 hours.",
    imageUrl: "/images/portfolio/all-care.png",
    liveUrl: "https://www.allcaredrainandleakdetection.com/",
    tags: ["Web App", "CMS", "Automation"],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Acts Heat and Air",
    description: "Provided digital infrastructure and web presence for a leading HVAC service provider, focusing on reliability and customer acquisition.",
    imageUrl: "/images/portfolio/acts.png",
    liveUrl: "https://actsheatandair.com/",
    tags: ["Web Development", "Local SEO"],
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Hometown Rock and Landscape, LLC",
    description: "Developed a scalable e-commerce platform and inventory management system for a major landscape materials supplier.",
    imageUrl: "/images/portfolio/hometown.png",
    liveUrl: "https://hometownrockandlandscape.com/",
    tags: ["E-commerce", "Inventory Management"],
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    name: "SmartHVAC Analytics",
    description: "AI-driven diagnostics platform for HVAC systems. Developed by Veruthia Consulting, LLC.",
    imageUrl: "/images/portfolio/smarthvac.png",
    liveUrl: "https://smarthvacanalytics.com/",
    tags: ["AI", "SaaS", "Diagnostics"],
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    name: "Veruthia Systems",
    description: "Internal operating system and project management dashboard designed for streamlined client service and internal workflows.",
    imageUrl: "/images/portfolio/veruthia.png",
    liveUrl: "#",
    tags: ["Internal Tools", "Productivity"],
  }
];
EOL
```

**Expected outcome:**
The file `src/lib/constants.ts` will be overwritten. The live preview of the website should immediately reflect the updated names, descriptions, and live URLs on the portfolio cards.
