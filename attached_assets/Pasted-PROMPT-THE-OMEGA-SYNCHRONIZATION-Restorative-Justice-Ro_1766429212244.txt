PROMPT: THE "OMEGA" SYNCHRONIZATION (Restorative Justice)
Role: You are Marcus, Lead Architect. Current Status: FULL AUDIT & LOCKDOWN. Context: We are correcting "Scope Drift" from the Night Shift. You must re-calibrate the entire build based on this TOTAL INVENTORY.

YOUR MISSION: Audit the current codebase against the 5 Dimensions below. If a feature exists, refine it. If it is missing, build it. Do not deviate.

DIMENSION 1: ATOMIC FAIL-SAFES (Technical Risk)
1. The "Ghost Asset" Prevention:

Action: Verify public/sitemap.xml and public/robots.txt exist. They must allow all crawlers.

Why: Without this, the site is not a "placed in service" asset for Section 179.

2. The "Build Failure" Prevention:

Action: Update next.config.js. Set typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true } and eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }.

Why: We cannot let a minor syntax error stop the deployment.

3. The "Tally Dead End" Prevention:

Action: In the Contact Form, ensure the onSubmit event waits 2000ms and then executes router.push('/success'). Do NOT show the default Tally "Thank You" screen.

4. The "404 Void" Prevention:

Action: Create a custom not-found.tsx page. Style it with the "Digital Noir" theme (Rich Black background).

5. The "FOUT" Prevention:

Action: Configure next/font to preload Playfair Display and Cinzel. Prevent "flash of unstyled text."

DIMENSION 2: THE PHYSICS ENGINE (The "App" Feel)
1. Mobile Physics:

Action: Apply overscroll-behavior: none to the body CSS. Kill the iOS "rubber band" effect.

Action: Ensure Lenis (smooth scroll) is active. The scroll must feel weighted.

2. Scrollbar Hygiene:

Action: Hide the default browser scrollbar. Implement a custom CSS scrollbar:

Width: 4px

Track: #050505 (Rich Black)

Thumb: zinc-700 (Dark Grey)

DIMENSION 3: THE TRUTH PROTOCOL (Content & Integrity)
1. Purge False Claims (Strict):

Target: SmartHVAC Analytics.

Fix: Remove "$100k Processed." REPLACE with: "Asset Valuation: $720,000 (Replacement Cost)."

Reason: We only use verified Technical Audit metrics.

2. Safe Retainer Logic (Update Pricing Cards):

Tier 1 (AI Voice): Subtext: "Retainer: Usage-Based (Call Volume)".

Tier 2 (Recovery): Subtext: "$150/mo Hosting & Security Only".

Tier 3 (Business Engine): Subtext: "Custom SLA & Maintenance Package".

3. The Full Portfolio (Add Missing Projects):

Asset 1: SmartHVAC Analytics (SaaS) - $720k Asset Valuation.

Asset 2: Metro-Barber-OS (Booking) - Zero No-Shows / Commission Logic.

Asset 3: Hometown Rock (Logistics) - 30+ Material Calculators.

Asset 4: Acts Heat & Air (Mini-SaaS) - Integrated Financing & Scheduling.

Asset 5: All Care Drain (SEO) - 98/100 SEO Score / Lead Capture.

4. The Process:

Add a section: 1. Audit (Discovery) -> 2. Blueprint (Strategy) -> 3. Build (Architecture) -> 4. Asset (Deployment).

DIMENSION 4: VISUAL PHYSICS (Brand Strictness)
1. Color Theory:

Action: Change all #000000 backgrounds to Rich Black (#050505).

2. The "White Card" Ban:

Target: The Featured Pricing Card (Business Engine).

Action: Make the background BLACK (#050505). Give it a 1px Gold/Zinc Border. Add a "RECOMMENDED" badge. No white backgrounds.

3. Logo Logic:

Header: "VERUTHIA" (Cinzel/Playfair mix). NO "LLC".

Footer/Legal: "Veruthia Consulting, LLC."

4. Social Credibility:

Action: Hardcode og:image and twitter:card tags in layout.tsx. Use a placeholder image from /public.

DIMENSION 5: THE LEGAL SHIELD
1. Section 179 Disclaimer:

Action: Add this text explicitly under the Pricing Grid and in the Footer: "Section 179 eligibility depends on your specific business situation. Please consult a certified CPA."

2. Legal Pages:

Action: Verify /legal/privacy and /legal/terms contain actual boilerplate text. Do not leave them empty.

EXECUTION: Audit the current build. Apply these fixes. GO.
